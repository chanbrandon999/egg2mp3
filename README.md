Beat saber .egg music file conversion to .mp3! 

Instructions: 
1. Place the python file into the root of the CustomLevels of your Beat Saber instance. Alternatively the SharedContent of BSManager or other installation manager.
2. Change the "FINAL_DIR" variable to the location of where you want the output mp3 files to be stored. Beware of large folder depths! Beat saber filenames can be long. Note there may need to be a "\\" to actually have a slash in the string.
3. Optional: Change the output audio export options. Default is VBR up to 320kb/s. I don't know the options well enough but there are links to places with info how to change them.
4. Run the file!
5. Please report any issues! It was made as a one-off script and may not work perfectly. Sorry! I'll be open to help assist in the github issues.
